We are going to interactively work together a do a data analysis for marketing performance. 
We will use python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib and other necessary libraries for analysis. 
You’ll find a SEO_analysis.csv file which has the following data: Keywords, current position,CPC,Volume, KD(keyword difficulty: How difficult is it to rank for the keyword on search engines). We are going to work around these data for the analysis of SEO performance.
You can start off with installing the necessary libraries, setup git, integrate with my repository(empty) from GitHub(you have login, I guess). As a first analysis: create an exploratory analysis of the data provided on the csv file. 
You’ll need to Create all the necessary plot and save it in the same root folder. Some times you must also analyse and create tables for analysis.
